============================

Taco Tuesday is a simple app that let's you decide what kind of taco your going to make.
There are a set amount of option to choice from Meats, veggies, and topping.

The inspiration for this app came from a mutual appreciation of tacos and the long list of customizable ingredients that can go in them.
We wanted to have a simple, yet expandable design to make our favorite dish how ever we see fit.


This app was built using the following:
HTML, CSS Javascript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.

There are no current wireframes or bootstraps tied to this application. Everything is designed by hand.


Instructions:
To begin,
  Under Create Taco, fill out a  name and image link.
  Then click details to further customize your taco
  Select your favorite meats, veggies and toppings
  Select the 'Create Taco' button and enjoy as you taco is made below.

  To update or correct changes to your taco, select your newly made taco by clicking the detail tab
  chose an updated item (Make sure the image link is imputed again) and click 'Update Taco'
